# YOLOv8 Object Detection on Custom Dataset

This project demonstrates how to train YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection, on your own custom dataset. Code is written in Python and presented in a Jupyter notebook (\`train.ipynb\`), which is hosted on Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account to use Google Colab
- A custom dataset of images annotated with bounding boxes and labels
- Basic knowledge of Python and deep learning concepts

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the \`train.ipynb\` notebook in Google Colab and follow the instructions provided. The notebook will guide you through the process of preparing your dataset, training the YOLOv8 model, and testing it on new images.

## Video Demo

## Credits

This project is based on the YOLOv8 implementation by [ultralytics/yolov8](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8) and uses the Roboflow platform for image annotation. Special thanks to the authors of these tools for making them freely available.
